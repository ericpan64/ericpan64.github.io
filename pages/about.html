- I'm an engineer from Arcadia, CA. Early childhood in Tampa, FL. Lived in 6 different states for at least a year

- My parents immigrated from Tianjin, China to pursue higher education at Rutger's and provide better opportunities that weren't available in China. My maternal grandparents moved to the US shortly after to help take care of me and my older sister.  I care about my family a lot and love them deeply.

- Think a lot about healthtech and fixing broken incentives in US healthcare. Spent a lot of time implementing FHIR APIs and using FHIR for research. Care most about serving clinical end-users and patients -- how to help people live more well

- I have a cat named Billy (short for Bilibino)
