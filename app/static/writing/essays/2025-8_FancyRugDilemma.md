# The Fancy Rug Dilemma

> This essay explores what I'll call the "Fancy Rug Effect" - how as means improve, abstract concepts gain value over practical ones. It also examines the corresponding dilemma: developing skills in the abstract increases the temptation to avoid practical problems. While not entirely new [[1]](#footnotes), hopefully this interpretation makes it more personal and possibly less ...fancy.

## Rug Shopping in Palo Alto

In Fall 2023, I moved from Stanford's graduate housing [[2]](#footnotes) into Palo Alto, splitting rent with three housemates. Walking downtown, I discovered Artsy Rugs - a luxurious artisan rug store occupying prime University Ave real estate. In Boston, where I'd worked as a software engineer, a friend had gifted me a fluffy hand-me-down rug. Here in Palo Alto, I was rugless again.

Curiosity got the best of me. Inside, hundreds of custom-made rugs told their special stories. I genuinely admired the craftsmanship - these weren't just floor coverings but works of art. After ten minutes, I found one matching the rustic vibe I wanted. The price tag made my brain automatically convert to "months of rent." I sheepishly exited, deciding my rental would remain rugless.

Months later, I discovered *another* fancy rug store on University Ave [[3]](#footnotes). How did these stores pay rent? Who buys these rugs? A cultured friend explained that rugs carry significant cultural value, serving as generational heirlooms. While I could appreciate this intellectually, trading months of expenses for floor decoration felt nuts. This was a world different from my own.

## The Fancy Rug Effect

The "Fancy Rug Effect": when immediate needs are met, abstract value propositions can carry more weight than concrete ones. A rug transcends function, becoming heritage, taste, identity. For Palo Alto's ultra-wealthy, a fancy rug might cost the same relative amount as my In-N-Out order [[4]](#footnotes). At that scale, perhaps only the fanciest rugs make sense.

The abstract realm preserves ideals while avoiding reality's imperfections. As someone with two master's degrees, I understand the appeal. We need abstraction to transform reality - this capacity has made humans Earth's dominant species [[5]](#footnotes). Yet abstraction also offers escape.

I occupy an uncommon middle. Some days I obsess over keeping API expenses under $10; other times I drop $200 on basketball shoes for my dust-collecting collection. I'll agonize over a $20 meal while nonchalantly spending thousands on tuition. Our unconscious standards make some "fancy rug" decisions simpler than others.

Thanks to my immigrant parents' hard work, I grew up upper-middle class, inheriting both their appreciation for making something from nothing and my own taste for fancy rugs. I pride myself on frugality [[6]](#footnotes) partly to honor their American dream pursuit. Yet what's the point of hoarding money if we suppress ourselves from experiences, communities, and values worth expressing? My journey chases different fancy rugs than my parents faced, with lower stakes and safety nets they never had.

## My Own Palace of Abstractions

After two years at Stanford, I moved back home with my mom and grandma to bootstrap my startup. Cleaning out my room, I confronted my personal fancy rug collection:
- Basketball shoes disproportionate to playing time
- Books I'll never read again
- Two MS degrees when one would've sufficed
- A startup idea kept deliberately vague

The recent LA wildfires forced a clarifying question: what would we save? Abstract values suddenly became concrete choices. Yet now, with no immediate threat, I'm boxing sentimental junk for garage storage - too painful to throw away, not valuable enough to keep accessible.

Working on startups, I've faced the "cold start" problem repeatedly: too shy to show unpolished work while knowing nobody cares the way I do. When hiding in the abstract, there's no failure, no criticism, unbounded possibilities. There's nothing wrong with embracing abstractness - that's how beautiful art gets made. But there's a difference between embracing and hiding, between running toward and running away.

This is the Fancy Rug Dilemma: stronger abstract reasoning makes it tempting to stay in abstraction rather than bridge back to reality. But serving our communities requires meeting people wherever they are.

## Different Rugs for Different Lives

During Stanford's Alternative Spring Break [[7]](#footnotes), we visited organizations supporting Bay Area migrant farmworkers. At one nonprofit, someone brought their motorcycle for a group photo, and we proudly raised our fists in a unified "Â¡SÃ­ se puede!". While we helped prepare some materials for events and outreach, the real value was showing up and learning how to support farmworkers in our careers. Returning to campus, many of us wondered if "selling out" to "big tech" also meant turning a blind eye to the noble workers we'd just met. Maybe there's a way to have both, and if not, that definitely doesn't have to be true indefinitely.

The contrast struck me: tech capitalists assigning millions to abstract ideas while farmworkers create concrete value under harsh conditions. Both groups have their fancy rugs. The motorcycle wasn't just transportation but freedom, pride, achievement. Different from a $10k rug, but serving the same human need for meaning.

At Stanford, I saw brilliant students trapped in fancy rug lifestyles - treating school as extended vacation from society (myself included). Aspiring healthtech entrepreneurs who've never worked in healthcare imposing clean abstractions on messy realities. It's "failure to launch" mixed with "pivot hell" - why commit to specific problems when you can stay abstractly superior, perpetually "exploring opportunities"?

## Bridging the Ideal and the Real

There's no real dichotomy between abstract thinking and practicality. The challenge is bridging these worlds and knowing when to cross. Whether in fancy rug territory or on bare floors, the best ideas meet people where they are [[8]](#footnotes) - in reality.

It takes courage to climb the ivory tower and more to descend. Growth happens amid uncertainty. Facing reality means accepting that someone always has it better, someone always has it worse. Improving reality requires facing it first.

But life is meant to be enjoyed too. A rug can transcend floor covering while remaining, fundamentally, something you walk on. The magic isn't choosing between practical and transcendent - it's holding both truths simultaneously.

## What's Your Fancy Rug?

Real progress exists in the vulnerability to make abstract ideas concrete, the maturity to accept good with bad, and the empathy to understand others' fancy rug pursuits. I used to think that buying a fancy rug was straight up bonkers, though now I can understand that while it's still bonkers for me, it's really meant for someone else.

My fancy rugs taught me that meaning-making is universal. We all need things transcending pure utility, connecting us to stories bigger than ourselves. The entrepreneur's vision, the farmworker's motorcycle, the collector's Persian silk - all attempts to bridge what is with what could be.

What's your fancy rug? How does it serve you? And when might it be time to actually walk on it?

Because even the fanciest rug is meant to connect us to the ground. And in special circumstances, they connect us to each other.
