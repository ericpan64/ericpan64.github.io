# The Fancy Rug Effect

> This essay goes over what I'll dub the "Fancy Rug Effect" (as means improve, abstract concepts gain value over practical ones) and its corresponding dilemma (developing skills in abstract reasoning increases the temptation to ignore more practical problems). This is an old idea in psychology relating to [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), though hopefully this interpretation makes it more interesting and maybe less... fancy.

## Rug shopping in Palo Alto

In Fall 2023, I moved out of Stanford's graduate housing [_E_] into Palo Alto splitting rent with three housemates. While walking in downtown, I came across Artsy Rugs -- a luxurous artisan rug store occupying an impressive corner of University Ave. Prior to starting my second MS at Stanford, I lived in Boston working as a Senior Software Engineer splitting rent with two other apartmentmates. When I moved into my Boston apartment, a good friend from undergrad was also moving out and gifted me a fluffy rug that still proudly decorates the living room. While I was once again a broke student, at least I had saved up a modest sum while working, and figured: why not? Let's check out Artsy Rugs.

I went into the store and gazed at the stacks of luxurious rugs -- multiple stacks and over hundreds to choose from, each custom made with its own styles. I admired the different styles and craftsmanship, and mind you a rug lasts for a while so I wanted to make sure the style matched the rustic, down-to-earth vibe I was going for. After maybe 10 minutes, I found one that I liked, though the price tag shocked me: I don't remember how much exactly, though it my mind it was in the unit of "months worth of rent", beyond my scope of comprehension. I sheepishly put the rug back and quietly exited the store and decided my current rental would go rug-less.

A couple of months later, to my surprise I discovered _other_ fancy rug store on University Ave -- also both luxurious and suspiciously sparse with foot traffic. I brought my discovery to a friend who, more cultured than I, brought up that rugs can carry significant cultural value and also acts as an item to be passed down generations. While I can appreciate the cultural and artistic value of a rug, as well as the idea of serving as a generational heriloom, the idea of trading months of living expenses for a rug seemed insulting -- maybe I'm just not rich enough to get it, or maybe it's just in Palo Alto.

This question bothered me for a while: what kind of place sustains not one, but TWO fancy rug stores [_A_]? And who buys this kind of stuff? Upon deeper reflection and observation of my time in Palo Alto and Stanford, I realized that a fancy rug is more than just a rug.

## The Fancy Rug Effect

The "Fancy Rug Effect" is as follows: when given the luxury to focus on abstract ideals, these ideals create self-sustaining worlds of their own distinct from the physical world [_B_]. In these fancy worlds, the messiness of reality is abstracted-away and the purity of ideas can shine -- a rug becomes more than a rug, it becomes a symbol for generational wealth, style, and longevity. This abstract ideal transcends the shortcomings of physical reality where a rug is just... a rug. For the ultra rich of Palo Alto, buying a fancy rug might be financially equivalent to me buying a cheeseburger and fries at In-N-Out [_C_]. At that point, maybe it makes sense, arguably even logical, to judge a rug by more than just its cover -- if we only need a couple of rugs over our lifetimes, maybe it's a good idea to make it matter, even moreso if it can pass down valuable ideas and symbolism which can otherwise be hard to maintain.

The realm of the abstract has some desirable properties: it can both preserve the purity of ideals while simultaneously avoiding the imperfections of reality, even if the abstractions are hard (as someone that voluntarily pursued two Master degrees, sh*t gets pretty abstract, sometimes I get lost in it too...). We often need to think abstractly to change reality based on ideals -- the ability to abstract and collaborate marks the intelligence that has allowed humans to currently occupy the dominant species on Earth [_D_]. 

Reality is difficult by default. Many people are either too grounded in the real world and/or don't have the luxury or interest in thinking about abstract ideals. For me, I'm somewhere in the middle: some days I obsess over optimizing how to get my daily living expenses to under $10/day, and other times I spend $200 on my nth pair of basketball shoes to add to my collection collecting dust at home. I simultaneously feel bothered paying $20 for a meal yet drop thousands of dollars paying for classes without batting an eye. I've grown up comfortably upper-middle class thanks to the hard work of my immigrant parents, and while many of my lifestyle choices are truly "fancy rug"-esque, I'd like to think that I'm also carrying-forward my parents (and grandparent's) grit, frugality, and appreciation that comes with accepting reality as-is: making more out of less, something out of nothing.


## The Allure of Abstraction

When Facebook rebranded as Meta in 2021, I was stumped: why would such a successful company rebrand entirely to it's (at the time) half-baked implmenetation of a dystopian virtual serfdom [_F_]? This felt incredibly forward-thinking and out-of-touch with my reality, especially after missing the in-person interactions amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when the legendary Snoop Dogg bought digital land, my curiosity piqued further -- maybe it wasn't such a dumb idea. And then I realized: it was a dumb idea for someone like me, but not as dumb for someone like Zucc or Snoop. Logically, the concept of land ownership can be viewed abstractly -- when we "buy" physical land, we're really buying permission and ownership as defined by the governing jurisdiction, and the pandemic demonstrated that some parts of life can be completely digital, so why not jump the gun on complete digital land ownership, a digital world with less limitations than the physical world and the ability to connect globally rather than locally?

As someone with _two_ MS degrees, I can testify that it can be tempting to keep things abstract. With the advancements in technology, there's no inherent reason why we should stay bounded by the digital world.

 As someone who completed an entire MS online (shoutout OMSCS -- highly recomend for those interested) and TA-ed remotely for two years, 

Grad school, was clearly valuable for me, though fundamentally: a lot of "this is what I did" -> "what would you do" (reality to abstract), yet school it becomes impossible to realistically bridge the most important part: "what I think I would do" -> "this is what I did" (abstract to reality)

- Working on startups personally, have had several "cold start" problems, being too shy about showing off my work, feeling too discouraged when no one cares, only to realize through experience and entrepreneur friends that's just part of the process, comparing your day-to-day to everyone elses' highlight reels isn't fair for anyone
- In abstract terms, there is no failure, and critisms are easily avoided as the degrees of freedom are literally unbounded
- In a world where the individual is both big-brain _and_ never wrong, it makes sense why it's tempting not to leave.

## The Fancy Rug Dilemma
- Fancy Rug Dilemma: given stronger abstract reasoning, it becomes more tempting to stay in abstraction rather than bridging back to messy reality
- Saw this a lot at the GSB -- business students that are generally so smart and capable yet get trapped in fancy rug lifestyles since business school is really just a vacation for most people.
- Aspiring healthtech entrepreneurs that have never worked in healthcare (myself included): fighting in a space where ideals need to survive broken and much less forgiving realities 
- "Failure to launch" -- why commit to a problem when can stay in abstract superiority of "doing it all", and knowing it'll work out abstractly because you go to Stanford? Simple: because that means it'll never be real


## Bridging the Ideal and the Real
- There's a false dichotomy between abstract thinking and practicality: the challenge isn't choosing between these, rather it's bridging these worlds and prioritizing the right ones
- Whether it's in fancy rug territory or not, the best ideas meet people wherever they are
  - By default it's reality, though maybe it doesn't have to be (yet it'll take a lot of reason to convince me otherwise). The truth will be somewhere in the middle, and most likely various combinations as human-computer interaction advances
- It takes courage to scale the ivory tower, and it takes even more courage to leave. Yet growth happens admist uncertainty. And facing reality is facing the truth: someone always has it better, and someone always has it worse. Improving reality means facing it, so hopefully more people can have it better overall. Though life is also meant to be enjoyed -- a rug can be enjoyed as more than a rug, while still acknowledging that it's fundamentally... a rug.

## Footnotes

[_A_] At the time I came up with this idea, there was indeed two fancy rug stores in downtown: Artsy Rugs and _ Rugs. Unfortunately _ Rugs closed their storefront, but don't fret: they have merely relocated to Redwood City where the rent is probably a bit more reasonable.

[_B_] This is a variant of the "luxury belief" discussion from years past, except focused on the inertia of change rather than the magnitude and direction

[_C_] I know you didn't ask, but my In-N-Out order is: cheeseburger animal style + both kinds of onions + extra lettuce, fries well-done, extra spread, and a water cup.

[_D_] E.g. despite being clearly weaker than mammoths, humans found a way to survive based on collaboration, tools, and advanced reasoning. However, reasoning too deep naturally makes things more complicated, see 100 men vs 1 gorilla debate. Also this is why AI can genuinely be an existential threat, though imo far, far more good will come first, and a practical threat over AGI leading to human exinction is ~100 years out...

[_E_] Shoutout Rains 🤙
