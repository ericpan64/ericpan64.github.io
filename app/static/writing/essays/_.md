Next essay:
- Early founder and co-founder psycology: like dating but worse
  - (reflecting on my own early journey working on Stoa Medical -- navigating uncertainty, goals, and waryness of commitment, ounces daoism and nihilism, grounding ironically in stoicism as organizing framework, wondering if it's arbitrary or just in my nature, thinking about AI in the context of writing code, thinking about what my job is and how to spend my time -- hacker brain vs business brain and switching between the two)
  - An infinite job search, though at least in a job search the heuristics are clear (skills fitting role, right aptitude to work together, paying money for skills, company wants to further revenue). To be explicit, clear does _not_ mean easy -- getting a job is particurily hard (especially in the current economy)
  - Orion Taraban "The Value of Others": relationships are an unequal transaction of complementary goods
  - "5 factors" of co-founder dynamics (helps with own search!)

#### Going to an "elite" school: the Fancy Rug dilemma
- Fancy Rugs in Palo Alto -- 20k rugs, what? Who buys this stuff?
	- Literal rug: just used to keep floor clean. Maybe outdoor rug dust off boots
	- Fancy rug: symbolic of artistry, something you can pass down generations, etc., _abstract_ ideas
- A broad generalization: the "fancy rug" spectrum
	- Before coming into Stanford, enjoyed "fancy rug" ideas, though fundamentally a "normal rug" guy
		- Grew up with immigrant parents who came from little, so I had plenty growing up. Very comfortable and healthy environment
		- Immigrant values: practical needs, though I've had the luxury of enjoying abstract ideas
	- Many people using education to advance themselves and their communities -- very much "normal rug" environments. Practical needs
- "Fancy rug" dilemma: the temptation to stay in the abstract, without going back to the practical needs and origins
	- Solving problems: "meeting people where they're at"
	- Life isn't that much better with a fancy rug, but it sure does feel a lot better thinking about them
	- Difficult to solve for people without understanding their needs properly
		- Likewise: should solve for own needs accordingly too! Sustainability and consistency provide the strongest opportunities to exdercise values
	- I'm far from immune -- candidly, applying for KH was my "fancy rug" dream: something that I would've enjoyed a ton. Though now, reconnecting with my "normal rug" self: using my "fancy" skills to solve some fking problems! Like I set out to do ðŸ’¯
- Nothing wrong with enjoying Fancy rugs. Both sides make sense.
- ... the real kicker: Palo Alto has not just one, but TWO fancy rug stores. Truly a one-in-a-kind place to be (afaik)

#### I miss the old Kanye, and the old democratic republic

... an argument for longer-form and more thoughtful discourse. And looking at the bigger picture. Give attention to ideas for their true value, not for the clickbait purposes (some things are truly egregious, and that's the extent of it, scale accordingly). Fragmentation of modern attention and society that is too quick to cancel. We're allowed to disagree with each other and still be civil -- that's the foundation of the USA and ideals of founding fathers.

#### Life isn't fair, though marketplaces should be
- Many things in life are arbitrary -- in another life I could've been born in poverty. In a much closer timeline, I could've never made it to the US (e.g. parents stay in China) and my life would look so, so differently
  - Unfair disadvantage: Dr Lin getting non-smoker lung cancer... Stories like this. Genuinely amazing and good people getting hit with terrible circumstances. It is sobering
  - Unfair advantage: growing up in stable, open-minded immigrant household (combination of grit, ambition, but also ability to zoom-out)
- However, many things are within our control. While our initial unconscious minds are basically determined by our parents + living condition (I don't recall coherent sentient thinking / recognization of self until I was maybe in middle school), there's SO much we can do about our conscious mind, AND we can re-program our subconscious minds through honest ACTION (though it takes a lot longer and is necessarily indirect)
- The world is much, much bigger than us. So necessarily need to collaborate with other people
- Life is already unfair -- marketplaces should be as fair as possible. Though people will unfortunately (and understandably) try to scam, almost out of an energy that despises the unfairness life wroughts as part of existance
- In my opinion, the best in-practice is capitalism, and the most idealistic is communism (though in-practice this has generally been corrupt). In terms of checking power, democratic republics are best in-practice (the US is a democratic republic, not a pure democracy) while the most idealistic is monarchy (i.e. assuming a pure + just leader that considers constituents, it's more efficient to simplify decision-making)
  - The US has generally succeeded due to strong ideals and roots in checking power with democratic principles and encouraging fair markets through capitist markets (where competition is used to check power). Until proven otherwise, I'm convinced this is the best existing model 
  - US Healthcare drives me crazy -- clear imbalance of power, _because_ it cannot be checked. Essentially promoting a communist structure (assume common good) while operating in capitalist environment. Alas, necessary to have, yet much better ways to do so

#### "A proxy for something else"

- The Psycology of money: security, freedom, etc.
	- Though having savings and money in the bank, not enough to be mindless, but enough to live well for a year. Is it really like that?
	- Rewiring thinking and approach: valuing time, though also being cognizant of things

The psycology of schools: an "optimal" GPA isn't static...
- Empirically: 3.3 GPA was told as "optimal": you're passing classes, but really hacking on other stufff
	- Really a proxy for people working all of the time on things they care about
- GPA is about how well you execute within a fixed stage and given assignments from others
	- Very valuable for corporate jobs -- how well did you follow orders
	- Valuable for entrepreneurship -- when you set a plan, you're giving youself orders

#### The stories we tell ourselves
- The inner narrative -- importance of shaping it
- "Law of attraction", more like retrofitting our understanding of reality
- Thinking of the boundary: the actualized, the potential, and the reality of things
- *Process over outcome*: nobody knows the outcome for sure (though absolutely in our advantage to predict and get good at it)
	- Always room to be pleasantly surprised
- Linking back to healthy behaviors: 
- "Reality Distortion"

On copying people you look up to: fake it til you make it...
- PG on writing essays
	- Rewatched the startup video maybe ~10 times. Wild!
- Grand Budapest Hotel: how you live is a homage to the people that shape you and their stories...


#### What are you most afraid of? (+ my answer)
- Giving it your all: requires *confronting reality and accepting the outcome as-is*. CANNOT control the outcome
- Biggest fear: not giving it my all because I couldn't confront reality because I didn't believe in myself...

Going off the societal "rails" - staying sane while pursuing creative work
... while staying sane

- Accept that it's a non-linear process
	- *The Practice*
- Measure progress against yourself
	- Learn to minimize envy from others -- inevitable, but a skill
- Think about the *floor* -- if 
	- Accept the risk, or raise the floor (for me: savings + education, though tbh, always have moving in with parents which is a blessing and made more school easier)

My answer (as of now): most afraid of being unconscious in my own life (e.g. "sleepwalking" or living an undeliberate life, "going through the motions", etc.). This means a lack of appreciation, gratitute for everything: joys, boredom, sorrow, etc... to reject it trades peace for ease. I'm ok with a hard life, and I want to do what it takes to cultivate peace, ideally for others and starting with myself.

#### Value Creation and Value Capture
2023.12.04 8:23 PM

Distinguishing between the two -- first is eng/design/etc., second is business, bridge is product

I care a lot about **value actualization** -- most of the times think that's through value creation...
