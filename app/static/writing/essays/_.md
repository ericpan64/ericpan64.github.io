Next essay:
- Early founder and co-founder psycology: like dating but worse
  - (reflecting on my own early journey working on Stoa Medical -- navigating uncertainty, goals, and waryness of commitment, ounces daoism and nihilism, grounding ironically in stoicism as organizing framework, wondering if it's arbitrary or just in my nature, thinking about AI in the context of writing code, thinking about what my job is and how to spend my time -- hacker brain vs business brain and switching between the two)
  - An infinite job search, though at least in a job search the heuristics are clear (skills fitting role, right aptitude to work together, paying money for skills, company wants to further revenue). To be explicit, clear does _not_ mean easy -- getting a job is particurily hard (especially in the current economy)
  - "5 factors" of co-founder dynamics (helps with own search!)

*A framework for Founders: pick 2*
- Each co-founder, pick 2 to completely own and focus on:
	- Product Design
	- Engineering
	- Business Operations
	- Sales + Marketing
- This is all in service of your *users*
- Extreme ownership -- *you're responsible for everything*
	- Want to be literate at everything -- wear multiple hats
        - FOCUS is essential for founders -- need to do everything, but can't do everything at once, and usually things take a certain amount of momentum to get a useful amount of things done
	- *Your main focus shouldn't be spread too thin* -- otherwise success becomes a moving target (a successful day from a business ops perspective: market validation and talking to people, which is absolute failure from engineering perspective -- you should've been pushing code and doing what you think, in service of what other people think, and not just doing what other people think)

#### On copying people you look up to: fake it til you make it...
- PG on writing essays
	- Rewatched the startup video maybe ~10 times. Wild!
- Grand Budapest Hotel: how you live is a homage to the people that shape you and their stories...

#### The psycology of schools: an "optimal" GPA isn't static...
- Empirically: 3.3 GPA was told as "optimal": you're passing classes, but really hacking on other stufff
	- Really a proxy for people working all of the time on things they care about
- GPA is about how well you execute within a fixed stage and given assignments from others
	- Very valuable for corporate jobs -- how well did you follow orders
	- Valuable for entrepreneurship -- when you set a plan, you're giving youself orders

#### "A proxy for something else"

- The Psycology of money: security, freedom, etc.
	- Though having savings and money in the bank, not enough to be mindless, but enough to live well for a year. Is it really like that?
	- Rewiring thinking and approach: valuing time, though also being cognizant of things

#### The stories we tell ourselves
- The inner narrative -- importance of shaping it
- "Law of attraction", more like retrofitting our understanding of reality
- Thinking of the boundary: the actualized, the potential, and the reality of things
- *Process over outcome*: nobody knows the outcome for sure (though absolutely in our advantage to predict and get good at it)
	- Always room to be pleasantly surprised
- Linking back to healthy behaviors: 
- "Reality Distortion"

#### What are you most afraid of?
- Giving it your all: requires *confronting reality and accepting the outcome as-is*. CANNOT control the outcome
- Biggest fear: not giving it my all because I couldn't confront reality because I didn't believe in myself...

#### Going off the societal "rails" - staying sane while pursuing creative work

... while staying sane

- Accept that it's a non-linear process
	- *The Practice*
- Measure progress against yourself
	- Learn to minimize envy from others -- inevitable, but a skill
- Think about the *floor* -- if 
	- Accept the risk, or raise the floor (for me: savings + education, though tbh, always have moving in with parents which is a blessing and made more school easier)

#### Value Creation and Value Capture
2023.12.04 8:23 PM

Distinguishing between the two -- first is eng/design/etc., second is business, bridge is product

I care a lot about **value actualization** -- most of the times think that's through value creation...
