# The Dao of Co-Founder "Dating"

> This essay goes over some personal philosophy of co-founder "dating" through the lens of Daoism and proposed frameworks for these phases. I am far from an expert in Daoism, though as the son of Chinese immigrants a lot of concepts resonate with me. I _am_ an expert in co-founder "dating" (self-proclaimed), though have gained tons of insights from various sources (some listed at end). I'm also a self-proclaimed expert in regular dating (semi-unfortunately), AMA (but first: suggested reading below)

<!-- Target length: 300-800 words. A ton of ideas -- get them out, though shorter is better! -->

## Co-founder "Dating": Like regular dating, but for work

- Common trope: "pick your co-founder like your partner/spouse, you'll spend more time with them than your actual partner/spouse!"
  - True, but isn't this true for most 60+ hour/week jobs? 
  - It's definitely important to pick a co-founder and be deliberate, though the seek for perfection can impede progress. 
  - That being said, I'm a strong believer in having high standards that are also _realistic_. People sutblely connote being "realistic" with lowing standards, though that shouldn't be true -- instead just keep getting better (at whatever you're aiming for). And life is complicated -- different people want different thing
  - Looking for a partner/spouse are similar though heuristics are very different. Let's explore some of the differences
- Regular dating: why it has started to suck
- Difference between co-founder and regular dating: co-founder relationship is _fundamentally_ a work relationship, NOT a personal one
  - Both correlate, though work comes first, period
  - These don't magically sort themselves out. Like in any relationship -- takes work, being deliberate, compromise, etc.

- (reflecting on my own early journey working on Stoa Medical -- navigating uncertainty, goals, and waryness of commitment, ounces daoism and nihilism, grounding ironically in stoicism as organizing framework, wondering if it's arbitrary or just in my nature, thinking about AI in the context of writing code, thinking about what my job is and how to spend my time -- hacker brain vs business brain and switching between the two)
- An infinite job search, though at least in a job search the heuristics are clear (skills fitting role, right aptitude to work together, paying money for skills, company wants to further revenue). To be explicit, clear does _not_ mean easy -- getting a job is particurily hard (especially in the current economy)


## Duality of the Dao: everything, and nothing (... what?)
- Concept of the "Dao" -- mythical spirit-like force embodying everything and nothing
    - (pull some quotes)
- My framing: increasing space for understanding the nuances of reality (the "grey" zone of most things)
    - N-dimensional space (N > 1000), though our brains only focus on 3 or less dimensions at a time. This focuses our lens on just one specific slice. Even if you PCA it, it's still just one lens.
    - I strongly believe in good and evil, since I believe in my valueset strongly. Everyone is entitled to their own valueset. Though in addition to individual frames of "good" and "evil", framing can be "better" or "worse".
- World is more and more polarized nowaways -- fragmentation of "all or nothing" mindset has become subtle

## Actions communicate Values (though Words can help)
- People speak with their actions
- In dating, both sides are gathering information within limited windows of time.
  - The simplest and most accessible means of information: words. Makes sense, should definitely do
- Words are often an appeal to desired values
- Actions are our real values

## Framework 1 (dating): aligning priorities with "Five Factors"

- The "Five factors":
  1. Mission -- specifically for one cause
  2. Impact -- generally for any cause, alignment with values
  3. Money -- specifically for personal economic profit
  4. Fame -- specifically for recognition, the "aura" of being an entrepreneur
  5. Lifestyle -- specifically for personal lifestyle
- When things are "great" and zero conflict: everyone wants to keep everything (duh)
- When things are "real" and non-zero conflict: _pick one_ to keep and actively act on, _pick one more_ to watch
- You can have everything, just not at once
  - It's not humanly possible to do more than one thing at a time by defining the unit of time -- just not possible. Some people might say that's "cheating", but hey, thanks for making it this far lol. Many things might happen at once, though for human action, our brains can only do one thing at a time (albeit some might get good at switching real fast, a la async compute patterns)
- Absolutely ok for people to have different priorities. Just helps a lot when they align (definitely top 1, good if top 2).
- There are many ways to slice this, so happy for suggestions on how to modify

## Framework 2 (relationship): everything 
- Each co-founder, pick 2 to completely own and focus on:
	- Product Design
	- Engineering
	- Business Operations
	- Sales + Marketing
- This is all in service of your *users*
- Extreme ownership -- *you're responsible for everything*
	- Want to be literate at everything -- wear multiple hats
        - FOCUS is essential for founders -- need to do everything, but can't do everything at once, and usually things take a certain amount of momentum to get a useful amount of things done
	- *Your main focus shouldn't be spread too thin* -- otherwise success becomes a moving target (a successful day from a business ops perspective: market validation and talking to people, which is absolute failure from engineering perspective -- you should've been pushing code and doing what you think, in service of what other people think, and not just doing what other people think)

## Conclusion
- Maybe a framing would be "pick your favorite co-worker"
- Better to be happy single than be in a relationship to just be alone
  - Definitely possible to do it alone, though definitely better to do it together _assuming it works for everyone_ (that's the hard part)
- For now, happy where I'm at and making slow and steady progress on my goals. It does get lonely, but alas, that's just part of life (for everyone!). Though ideally, yes one day I'd like a girlfriend, erm, I mean co-founder, or co-worker? ... hrm...
