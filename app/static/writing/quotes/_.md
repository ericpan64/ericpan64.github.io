# Quotes that I enjoy

Some quotes that I've enjoyed (an incomplete running list, no particular order):
- "'He fixes radios by _thinking_!' The whole idea of thinking, to fix a radio — a little boy stops and thinks, and figures out how to do it — he never thought that was possible." - Richard Feynman in his book [_Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!_](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/misc/feynman.pdf)
- "I guess we'll never know." - Kanye West in his [Grammy acceptance speech](https://youtu.be/nF1OrI79oIE?si=HBrP9HZxa-ws6Cye) (also, I miss the old Kanye)
- "Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself." - Morpheus from [_The Matrix_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix)
- "My father says \[Azula\] was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born. I don't need luck though, I don't want it. I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong. It's made me who I am." - Zuko from [_Avatar the Last Airbender_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
