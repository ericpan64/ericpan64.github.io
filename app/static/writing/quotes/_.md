# Quotes that I enjoy

Some quotes that I've enjoyed (an incomplete running list, no particular order):
- "Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself." - Morpheus from _The Matrix_
- "My father says she (Azula) was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born. I don't need luck though, I don't want it. I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong. It's made me who I am." - Zuko from _Avatar the Last Airbender_
- "If your gonna be dumb, you gotta be tough" -Roger Alan Wade in [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/1jFqNxoIpLHkor2pGQiaDu?si=03c2b22abb9c4c3d)
