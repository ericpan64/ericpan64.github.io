Sprites + images from: 
1. https://www.pokencyclopedia.info/en/index.php?id=sprites
2. https://www.serebii.net/yellow/pikachu.shtml

Also consider browsing cursors from: http://www.rw-designer.com/

Original author `readme.txt` files are available in the corresponding dir -- check out their work!

... also `.ani` files apparently aren't supported in browsers (historically a Windows thing)

OTHER IDEA: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon sprites (make myself from base img): https://www.pokencyclopedia.info/en/index.php?id=sprites/spin-off/ani_md-rt
